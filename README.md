# ContactVault
This Contact Manager application demonstrates fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a modern full-stack approach. Built with MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and Next.js, it allows users to create, update, and delete contact information through a sleek interface powered by NextUI.

The project focuses on connecting a MongoDB database, creating RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express, and serving the application with Next.js. It showcases best practices in back-end API creation and front-end integration, making it a great example for understanding how to build a full-stack application from scratch with a database, server-side APIs, and an interactive client-side interface.
